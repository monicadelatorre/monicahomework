Data Analyzed: csv files named city_data.csv and ride_data.csv

Analysis performed using pandas, jupyter notebook and matplotlib to create plots.

Observations:
The following observations can be made by analyzing the city and driver data.

The bubble plot shows us that the rural areas have a higer fare average while having less rides per city. The higher fares may be charged to compensate for not having as much business.

From the pie charts we can make two additional observations. First, the Urban cities are shown to have more drivers when compared to rural and suburban cities. Urban drivers make up more that 80 percent of all the drivers. Second, being a driver in a suburban area is the best because, although they only make up 16.5% of the drivers they are getting a larger portion than that of the fares and rides.
